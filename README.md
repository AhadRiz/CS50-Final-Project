Description:
The PIEAS Chatbot is an interactive tool designed to assist users with information related to the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS). This project was developed as part of my final assignment for the CS50P course, aiming to integrate artificial intelligence with a user-friendly interface to provide quick responses to common queries about PIEAS.

Project Structure:
project.py: This is the core of the chatbot. It contains the logic for generating responses based on user input. The file includes functions for loading data, preprocessing user inputs, and mapping keywords to the relevant information stored in a JSON file. The main function loops to continuously receive input from the user until they decide to exit the conversation. The script also includes the nltk library to tokenize and filter the user's input, making it more understandable for the bot.

app.py: This file integrates the chatbot with a Flask web application, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bot. The app routes handle the homepage and the interaction between the user and the chatbot. The get_bot_response function sends the user's input to the bot and returns the generated response.

pieas_data.json: This JSON file serves as the data repository for the chatbot. It contains all the information the bot can use to answer queries, including details about admissions, courses, contact information, fee structure, SAT requirements, and location details. Each piece of information is keyed to specific keywords that the bot uses to map user queries to the correct responses.

Functionality:
The chatbot is designed to recognize keywords from the user's input and provide relevant responses. For instance, if a user asks about "admissions," the bot will return information about BS and MS admissions at PIEAS. The bot's responses are generated by mapping keywords to corresponding data entries in the pieas_data.json file. The bot also features an exit mechanism that gracefully ends the conversation with a farewell message.

Design Choices:
One of the key decisions was to use the nltk library for natural language processing, which helps in efficiently tokenizing and filtering the input. This choice enhances the bot's ability to understand user queries more effectively by removing common stopwords and focusing on the main keywords.

Another important decision was to store the bot's knowledge base in a JSON file. This allows for easy updates and expansions of the bot's knowledge without needing to alter the core program logic. This design makes the chatbot scalable and maintainable as more information about PIEAS can be added over time.

Future Enhancements:
While the current version of the chatbot effectively handles a range of queries, there is potential for further development. Future improvements could include integrating an online search feature or a GPT model to handle more complex or unforeseen queries that the bot's current dataset does not cover.

Overall, this project was a rewarding experience in combining programming with practical application. It showcases the use of Python, Flask, and natural language processing to create a helpful tool for prospective and current students of PIEAS.
